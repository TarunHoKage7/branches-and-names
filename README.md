This is a basic CRUD application
(CRUD- Create, Read, Update, Delete)

I have used MongoDB, NodeJS, ExpressJS along with some HTML, CSS , and JS.

This is a database to store people's names and their branches(this was meant to be a student name and their branch). 

We add reservations with null-null key:value pairs and can delete such reservations.

Updates:

Should change the update method to replace a given name with another given pair,

Should update delete to delete a given pair
